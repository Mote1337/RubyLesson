.getc -> retrieves the next character and waits for a new one

.getbyte -> retrieves the next byte and waits for a new one

  getc and getbyte return nil at the end of a file (eof),
  they wait for user input if called on $stdin

.read -> read until eof, with blocking

.read_nonblock max_length -> read max_length without blocking

.readchar -> read single char with blocking until eof, raises error and blocks

.readbyte -> as above but with bytes

.readline -> like 'gets' but reaises an error
 at eof
